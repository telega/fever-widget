# Übersicht Fever Hotlinks Widget

Made for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

This widget pulls hotlinks from your [Fever](http://feedafever.com/) installation and displays them on the desktop.

## Options

You need to add the URL of your Fever installation, your username and password into `fever.coffee`. 


## Thoughts
The widget uses the node crypto functions to hash the user:pw. Is this the best way to do it? I'm open to suggestions.
